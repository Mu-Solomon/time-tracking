### What I learned

It's been really challenging for me to build it up to an extent that I had to re-take the CSS Flex-box course and developed this trial first [Flex-box trial]()

```css
    #look span:first-child {
        flex:1 1 10%;
        /*background-color: rgb(102, 98, 95);*/
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        height: 12vh;
    }
```
